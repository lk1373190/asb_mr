
# Assessing causality in the relationship between resting heart rate and antisocial behaviour: A Mendelian randomisation study.


## Introduction
The current repository contains scripts and data for reproducing the findings from the article ["Assessing causality in the relationship between resting heart rate and antisocial behaviour: A Mendelian randomisation study."][INSERT BIORXIV LINK HERE]. Scripts are provided in .Rmd and .md formats (.md format is recommended for viewing)


## Technologies

## Sources
A lot of the code used in this project has been inspired by the "TwoSampleMR" package and tutorial by
[@mrcieu](https://mrcieu.github.io/TwoSampleMR/articles/introduction.html)

The data analysed in the MR analysis were sourced from the following Genome Wide Association Studies
### 1. Antisocial behaviour
        - ["Broad Antisocial Behaviour Consortium"] [INSERT BIORXIV LINK]

### 2. Resting heart rate
        - ["CONSORTIUM"] [INSERT ARTICLE LINK]

### 3. Heart rate variability
        - ["CONSORTIUM"] [INSERT ARTICLE LINK]

### 4. Heart rate during exercise
        - ["CONSORTIUM"] [INSERT ARTICLE LINK]
